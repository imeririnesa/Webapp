            The Bellman-Ford algorithm is designed to find the shortest paths from a single source vertex to all other vertices in a weighted graph. It is particularly useful for graphs that contain negative weight edges.
        </p>
        <p>
            Unlike Dijkstra's algorithm, the Bellman-Ford algorithm can handle graphs with negative weights by detecting negative weight cycles. It iterates over all edges up to |V| - 1 times, where |V| is the number of vertices in the graph, ensuring that the shortest path is accurately computed even with negative weights.

            <strong>Key Features:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Handles negative weight edges and detects negative weight cycles.</li>
                <li>Provides a reliable solution for graphs with negative weights.</li>
                <li>Less efficient compared to Dijkstra's algorithm for graphs with non-negative weights.</li>
            </ul>
