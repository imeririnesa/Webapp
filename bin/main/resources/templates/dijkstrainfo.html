        <p>
            Dijkstra's algorithm is a classic algorithm used in graph theory to find the shortest paths from a single source vertex to all other vertices in a weighted graph. It is widely applied in network routing protocols, geographical mapping systems, and various optimization problems.
        </p>
        <p>
            The algorithm operates by iteratively selecting the node with the smallest known distance, updating the distances to its neighbors, and marking the node as processed. This continues until all nodes are processed, ensuring that the shortest paths from the source to all other nodes are determined.

            <strong>Key Features:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Efficient for graphs with non-negative weights.</li>
                <li>Useful in real-time applications such as GPS navigation and network routing.</li>
                <li>Provides an optimal solution for finding the shortest paths.</li>
            </ul>
